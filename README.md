# MEANTodo
Todo App made with the MEAN stack


#Purpose
This app is to demonstrate utilization of all elements of the MEAN stack.

* DB: MongoDB
* SERVER: Nodejs w/ Express
* MV*: Angular

other tech:

* Angular-ui-bootstrap
* Angular-animate
* Angular-messages
* Angular-route
* Satellizer
* Bcryptjs
* Body-parser
* Jwt
* Moment
* Mongoose


#About / Roadmap
*  Mean Todo is a robust todo list.  It features a secure login system and and token based authentication. A logged in Doer
will then be able to create todo lists, and populate those lists with tasks.  Each task will have information about that task.
Such As:

 - Task
 - Notes about Task
 - Date create/assigned
 - Completed status
 - Completed date (if applicable)

* As a logged in test Doer (clicking the test user signin) you have access to all features, though lists and tasks created by
that test user will expire and be removed after 24hours.

*Sorting options, show/hide completed tasks, clear all completed tasks.   Possible - require task be marked completed to be deleted?  

*Add warnings/alert/cofirms when deleting lists with incomplete todos or todos from being deleted without being complete.

#Future Plans

* As a doer you can add people to certain lists, and assign tasks.   

* lists created by a Doer will give them admin rights to that list, and can assign rights to Doers they have added to those lists.
